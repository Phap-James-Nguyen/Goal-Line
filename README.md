# Goal-Line

**Affordable Goal-Line Technology for Soccer** âš½  
A system designed to accurately detect whether a soccer ball has fully crossed the goal line using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress
This project is still under active development. We're currently focusing on improving detection accuracy, reducing latency, and testing real-world scenarios.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset
We're training our models using a custom dataset hosted on Roboflow:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Current Dataset](https://app.roboflow.com/goalline/)

### ðŸ“Œ Features (Coming Soon)
- Real-time ball tracking using YOLO-based models
- Goal-line detection using spatial analysis
- High frame rate video processing
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Cost-effective hardware design
- Real time communication
